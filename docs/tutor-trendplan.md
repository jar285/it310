## Database Implementation

### Overview

TutorTrend requires a robust database to store and manage various types of data including user information, course details, tutor profiles, transactions, and more. This document outlines the database implementation plan, including schema design, data relationships, and implementation checkpoints.

### Database Schema

Based on the application's needs, we'll implement the following key database models:

1. **Users**
   - Student profiles
   - Tutor profiles
   - Administrators

2. **Courses**
   - Course metadata (title, description, price)
   - Course content (sections, lessons)
   - Course ratings and reviews

3. **Tutoring**
   - Tutor availability
   - Session bookings
   - Locations
   - Tutor reviews

4. **E-commerce**
   - Shopping cart
   - Orders
   - Transactions
   - Payment information

### Implementation Approach

We'll use a combination of:

- **Prisma ORM** for database interactions
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- **Redis** for caching and session management

## Search Functionality

### Overview

The search feature will allow users to find courses and tutors based on various criteria. It needs to be fast, accurate, and able to handle complex queries with filtering and sorting options.
