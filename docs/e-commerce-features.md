- **CartItem**: Represents an item in a user's shopping cart
- **Order**: Represents a completed purchase
- **OrderItem**: Represents an individual course within an order

### API Endpoints

#### Cart API

- `GET /api/cart`: Retrieve the current user's cart
- `POST /api/cart`: Add an item to the cart
- `DELETE /api/cart`: Clear the entire cart
- `DELETE /api/cart/[id]`: Remove a specific item from the cart

#### Order API

- `GET /api/orders`: Retrieve all orders for the current user

### Authentication and Authorization

All e-commerce features require authentication using NextAuth.js. Users must be logged in to:
