# Dashboard Update Issue Analysis

## Current Problem
After a user pays for a course, the dashboard isn't updated to show the purchased course. This suggests there might be issues in one or more of the following areas:

1. **Webhook Processing**: The webhook might not be creating enrollments correctly
2. **Enrollment Creation**: There might be issues with how enrollments are created in the database
3. **Dashboard Data Fetching**: The dashboard might not be fetching the latest data after payment
4. **API Response Format**: The API might be returning data in an unexpected format
5. **Navigation Flow**: The user might not be properly redirected after payment

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Webhook Processing
- Check if the webhook is being triggered correctly
- Verify the webhook is creating enrollments
- Add more detailed logging to the webhook handler

### 2. Enrollment Creation
- Check if the enrollment repository methods are working correctly
- Verify the Prisma schema for enrollments
- Test enrollment creation directly

### 3. Dashboard Data Fetching
- Check if the dashboard is fetching data on mount
- Verify if the dashboard is fetching data after navigation
- Add a refresh mechanism to the dashboard

### 4. API Response Format
- Ensure all API endpoints return data in a consistent format
- Check if the frontend is handling the API responses correctly

### 5. Navigation Flow
- Verify the redirect after payment
- Add a refresh mechanism after successful payment

## Potential Solutions

1. **Add Refresh Mechanism**: Implement a refresh mechanism in the dashboard to fetch the latest data
2. **Improve Webhook Logging**: Add more detailed logging to the webhook handler
3. **Fix Enrollment Creation**: Ensure enrollments are created correctly
4. **Standardize API Responses**: Ensure all API endpoints return data in a consistent format
