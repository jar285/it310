# TutorTrend Data Enhancement Plan

## Current Issues

### 1. Tutors Page
- No tutors are displaying on the tutors page
- The API endpoint is working correctly, but there may not be enough tutor data in the database
- We need to create more diverse tutor profiles with proper user relationships

### 2. Courses Page
- No courses are displaying on the courses page
- We've added sample courses to the database, but they may not be properly queried
- The issue might be in the course repository implementation or API route

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix Tutors Display
1. Create a script to generate additional tutor profiles with diverse specializations
2. Ensure proper relationships between tutors and users
3. Add realistic tutor data including education, experience, and profile images
4. Test the tutors API endpoint to verify data is being returned correctly

### 2. Fix Courses Display
1. Debug the courses API endpoint to ensure it's correctly querying published courses
2. Check the course repository implementation for any filtering issues
3. Ensure proper relationships between courses and tutors
4. Verify that the courses added via our seed script are properly published

### 3. Data Consistency
1. Ensure all tutors have associated courses
2. Add reviews for both tutors and courses to make the platform feel more realistic
3. Implement proper error handling in API routes

## Expected Outcomes

1. Tutors page will display multiple tutors with diverse specializations
2. Courses page will display all published courses with proper filtering
3. Users will be able to browse, filter, and search for both tutors and courses
4. The cart functionality can be tested with the available courses
